* Introduction

Just my configuration files for sway, Emacs and a terminal. Comfortable for me.

* Installation

You can simply ~stow .~ in the directory. This will not, sadly, install the packages that are used in the configuration, but you are still able to install them using your native package manager. Some time ago I used ~guix~ package manager, but I moved from it.

** Packages list

This package list covers all packages that are used in the configuration. Not including ~Iosevka Nerd Font~.
